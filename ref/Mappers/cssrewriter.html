    <h1>cssrewriter mapper</h1><p class="paragraph"/>The "cssrewriter" is the second phase of CSS rewriting.<p class="paragraph"/>It seeks out urls in the CSS resources that are prefixed with "resource:" having been previously processed by csspreprocessor, and then converts them to the new final URL of the resource.<p class="paragraph"/>For example if the target resource, an image, has moved and been renamed, the new URL written to the CSS will reflect this.
