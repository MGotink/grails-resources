    <h1>bundle mapper</h1><p class="paragraph"/>The "bundle" mapper adds together resources of the same type to reduce the number of files your client pages request.<p class="paragraph"/>The "bundle" mapper looks at the value of the "bundle" property on resources and if found, will add the resource to a new synthetic aggregated resource.<p class="paragraph"/>This aggregated resource is itself processed through mappers, so it is subject to the other optimisations you apply to the kind of resource the bundle is aggregating.<p class="paragraph"/>Bundles are always in the base directory of the static resources folder - which means references to files inside the bundle must be re-adjusted so they continue to refer to the same files. This is made possible for CSS files by the <a href="../../ref/Mappers/csspreprocessor.html" class="Mappers">csspreprocessor</a> and <a href="../../ref/Mappers/cssrewriter.html" class="Mappers">cssrewriter</a> mappers.
