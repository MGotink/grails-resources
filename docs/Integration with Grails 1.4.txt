The Plan
========


Adapting existing stuff
=======================

g:resource -> detect resourceService and call into r:resource if present
g:img -> new tag, calling into g:resource
g:javascript -> detect resourceService and delegate to r:script as needed

Deprecate g:createLink, add g:url (nothing to do with resources...) Adapt
g:link to do resourceLink functionality (minus resources - see doResourceLink
in resources taglib), delegating to r:resourceLink if resources installed

All other resource-linking tags should be fine, deferring to g:resource
