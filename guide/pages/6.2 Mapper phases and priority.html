    The example mapper shows the "phase" property being set to MapperPhase.MUTATION. The <a href="http://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-resources/blob/master/src/groovy/org/grails/plugin/resource/mapper/MapperPhase.groovy" target="blank">MapperPhase</a> enumeration provides the possible mapping phases in the order in which they occur during processing of resources:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>enum MapperPhase &#123;
    GENERATION, // create <span class="java&#45;keyword">new</span> assets = compile less files
    MUTATION, // alter/improve assets (may mean creating <span class="java&#45;keyword">new</span>/deleting aggregated resources) = spriting
    COMPRESSION, // reducing the file size but maintaining semantics = minify
    LINKNORMALISATION, // convert all inter asset references into a normal form = css links
    AGGREGATION, // combining mutiple assets into one = bundling
    RENAMING, // moving of physical assets = hashing
    LINKREALISATION, // convert normalised inter asset references into real form = css links
    ALTERNATEREPRESENTATION, // attach different representations of the asset = gzipping
    DISTRIBUTION, // moving assets to their hosting environment = s3, cdn
    ABSOLUTISATION, // update inter asset references to their distributed equivalent = css links
    NOTIFICATION // let the world know about the <span class="java&#45;keyword">new</span> resources = cache invalidation
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>In most cases it will be enough to specify your phase and operation (see next section). However in some cases there may be issues where multiple mappers in the same phase must operate in a specific order. In those cases a "priority" property can be set to specify the priority integer.<p class="paragraph"/>Mappers will be executed in phase order, in order of ascending priority within each phase. The default priority if not specified is equivalent to zero.
