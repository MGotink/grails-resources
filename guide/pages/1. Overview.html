This plugin provides the Resources framework for Grails.<p class="paragraph"/>The issues that the Resources framework tackles are:
<ul class="star">
<li>Web application performance tuning is difficult</li>
<li>Correct load order for resources that depend on others</li>
<li>Deferring inclusion of JavaScript to the end of the document</li>
<li>The need for a standard way to for Grails plugins to expose static resources</li>
<li>The need for an extensible processing chain to optimize resources</li>
<li>Preventing inclusion of the same resource multiple times</li>
<li>The need for identical behaviour in development and production</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>The Resources plugin achieves these goals by introducing new artefacts and processing the resources using the server's local file system.<p class="paragraph"/>In tandem with Sitemesh layouts and the Grails plugin dependency system, you gain the ability to express dependencies on specific UI libraries, and the ability to specify the resources that a page needs anywhere in the page GSPs or even in rendered GSP templates.<p class="paragraph"/>The Resource framework tags confer a whole new level of abstraction and power to application and plugin developers. It makes possible new patterns for managing resources and smart handling of JavaScript and CSS code.<p class="paragraph"/>It adds artefacts for declaring resources, for declaring "mappers" that can process resources, and a servlet filter to serve processed resources.<p class="paragraph"/>
